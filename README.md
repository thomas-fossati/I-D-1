* <b>CoRE Application Descriptions</b> <br>
  <i>draft-hartke-core-apps</i> <br>
  The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications
  consist of reusable components such as Internet media types
  and link relation types. This document defines a simple
  standard that application designers can use to describe the
  interface of their application in a structured way so that
  other parties can develop interoperable clients and servers
  or reuse the components in their own applications. <br>

* <b>The Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL)</b> <br>
  <i>draft-hartke-t2trg-coral</i> <br>
  The Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL) is a compact,
  binary representation format for building RESTful, hypermedia-driven
  applications that run in constrained environments. <br>
