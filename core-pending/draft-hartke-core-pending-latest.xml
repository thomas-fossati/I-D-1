        This document proposes a new type of response for the Constrained
        Application Protocol (CoAP) called a "Pending" response. A CoAP
        server can use a Pending response to indicate that it has accepted a
        request but has not yet started processing it or that processing the
        request will take longer than a client is typically willing to wait for
        a response.

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"/> is
        a request/response protocol not unlike HTTP. CoAP defines no upper bound
        for the time between a request and the resulting response. For example,
        a CoAP-over-UDP server is expected to return an empty Acknowledgement to
        the client if it cannot provide a response right away, but there is no
        limit on the time when the server should return the Separate Response.
      </t>

      <t>
        In particular in the case of requests with long processing times, a CoAP
        client faces the problem that it cannot easily determine how long it
        should wait for the response and whether the CoAP server is actually
        still processing the request. Long processing times occur, for example,
        when requests need manual intervention to authorize their processing, or
        when they perform a long sequence of remote actions. An example for this
        is the "possibly long" authorization request specified in <xref
        target="I-D.vanderstok-ace-coap-est">EST-coaps</xref>.
      </t>

<t> Additionally, with long response times, a client is likely to start multiple requests to a given server, and needs to know the mapping between request and returned data.
</t>

      <t>
        This document proposes a new kind of response in CoAP, called a
        "Pending" response. The semantics of this response are modelled after
        the <xref target="RFC7231">HTTP 202 (Accepted) status code</xref>:
        <list>
          <t>
            The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been
            accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
            The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might
            be disallowed when processing actually takes place. [...] The
            representation sent with this response ought to describe the
            request's current status and point to (or embed) a status monitor
            that can provide the user with an estimate of when the request will
            be fulfilled.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Pending responses are not intended for overload cases, which are
        better handled by the 5.03 (Service Unavailable) response code.
      </t>

      <section title="Terminology">

        <t>
          Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
          described in <xref target="RFC7252"/> and <xref target="RFC7641"/>.

          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
          "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

    <section title="Pending Responses">

      <t>
        A Pending response is denoted by a response code in the 2.xx range and a
        Content-Format Option that is set to content-format ID TBD1.
      </t>

      <t>
        A 2.01 (Creation Pending) response in reply to a POST request indicates that the
        result of processing the request is not available yet, for example,
        because the server needs more time to process the request than a client
        is typically willing to wait for a response. The server MAY specify a
        location using the Location-* options where the result will become
        available. If the server does not specify a location, the result will
        become available at the target resource of the POST request. To retrieve
        the result, the client MAY poll or observe the resource at this
        location using the GET request method.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        A 2.02 (Deletion Pending) response in reply to a DELETE request
        indicates that the server has accepted the request but the target has
        not been fully deleted yet.
      </t>

      <t>
        A 2.04 (Change Pending) response in reply to a POST or PUT request
        indicates that the server has accepted the request but the result of
        processing the request is not available yet.
      </t>

      <t>
        A 2.05 (Content Pending) response in reply to GET request indicates that the
        target resource exists but a representation of the resource is not
        available yet. The Max-Age Option indicates after what time a client
        should retry its GET request to retrieve the representation. The client
        MAY <xref target="RFC7641">observe the resource</xref> to get
        notified when the representation becomes available (see <xref
        target="observing"/> for details).
      </t>

      <t>
        The payload of a Pending response MAY be a brief human-readable
        diagnostic message, explaining the situation, or MUST be absent.
      </t>

      <t>
        The cacheability of Pending responses is as specified for the respective
        response code.
      </t>

      <section title="Observing Resources" anchor="observing">

        <t>
          When a client registers to observe a resource <xref target="RFC7641"/>
          for which no representation is available yet, the server MAY send one
          or more 2.05 (Content Pending) notifications before sending the first actual 2.05
          (Content) or 2.03 (Valid) notification. The possible resulting
          sequence of notifications is shown in <xref target="figure-1"/>.
        </t>

        <figure anchor="figure-1" title="Sequence of Notifications">
<artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
      __________       __________       __________
     |          |     |          |     |          |

]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>
          Unless the server is unwilling to add the client to the list of
          observers, each 2.05 (Content Pending) notification MUST include an Observe
          Option with a sequence number as specified in <xref
          target="RFC7641"/>. Otherwise, the registration request falls back to
          a normal GET request.

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
        This section analyses the possible threats related to Pending
        responses. It is meant to inform protocol and application developers
        about the security limitations of the response code as described in this
        document.
      </t>

      <t>
        A Pending response is subject to the same general security
        considerations as all CoAP responses as described in Section 11 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"/>. Specifically, the security considerations for the
        response code are closest to those of the Observe Option as stated in
        Section 7 of <xref target="RFC7641"/>, because the server stores
        additional state over an extended period.
      </t>

      <t>
        Pending responses are secured following the recommendations for
        the existing CoAP response codes as specified in Section 9 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"/>. When additional security techniques are standardized
        for CoAP (e.g., based on object security), these are then also available
        for securing the responses.
